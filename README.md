## Hi there! 🙋🏻‍♀️
I'm César, a self-taught data analyst from Argentina, who also has Italian citizenship but lives in Spain!</br>

Throughout this time, I have developed some interesting skills, especially using Microsoft Excel, even before it was called data analysis. I am determined to keep learning about new tools and cultivating the abilities that help me become a successful Data Analyst.</br>
